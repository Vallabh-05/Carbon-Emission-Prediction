# 🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis Project

---

## 📘 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline to **analyze climate change data** using Python. It covers the full data science workflow:  
📥 Data Collection → 🧹 Cleaning → 📊 Exploration → 🤖 Model Building → 📈 Insights.

The dataset is based on historical climate indicators and is ideal for learning and demonstrating data analysis and machine learning techniques.
