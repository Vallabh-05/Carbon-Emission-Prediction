# Climate Change Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing climate change-related data through a structured pipeline involving data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building. The data is derived from global climate records and is used to develop insights and predictive models related to climate variables.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - openpyxl (for `.xls` file reading)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl
````

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   Open `1_data_preparation.ipynb` to clean and preprocess the raw data from `climate_change_download_0.xls`. The output is stored in `data_cleaned.csv`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   Use `2_data_exploration.ipynb` to perform visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.

3. **Model Building**:
   In `3_model_building.ipynb`, various machine learning models are trained and evaluated using the cleaned data.

## Output

The output of this project includes:

* Cleaned dataset
* Visual insights from EDA
* Trained model(s) and performance metrics
